# Cards56 Web Application
## About this project
This is a multi-player online card game web application written in .NET core and Java Script.

## Running this application in docker (on an ubuntu server)

This docker is coded with an intention to depoy for the domain 56cards.net. That said, it can be run for other domains also. However, some of the code that refers to 56cards.net needs to be changed.

1. Remove any previous instances of the container
```bash
# stop and remove any running instances of cards56web
docker rm -f cards56web

# get latest version of cards56web
docker pull bheemboy/cards56web

# remove any dangling images
docker rmi $(docker images --filter "dangling=true" -q --no-trunc)

```

3. Download `5.1.deploy-cards56.sh` and run it
```bash
# Get docker-compose.yml from github
mkdir -p ~/docker
rm ~/docker/5.1.deploy-cards56.sh; wget -P ~/docker --no-cache https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bheemboy/Cards56/master/scripts/5.1.deploy-cards56.sh
rm ~/docker/5.2.renew-56cards.net-cert.sh; wget -P ~/docker --no-cache https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bheemboy/Cards56/master/scripts/5.2.renew-56cards.net-cert.sh
chmod +x ~/docker/5.*.sh

bash ~/docker/5.1.deploy-cards56.sh production
```
You can now access the application by going to https://65cards.net.

2. Set up a cron job to autmatically renew the letsencrypt certificate. I added the following to crontab
```bash
0 6 * * thu /home/rehman/docker/5.2.renew-56cards.net-cert.sh
```
